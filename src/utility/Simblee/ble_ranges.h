  @brief Definition of SVC, event and option number subranges for each API module.

  @note
  SVCs, event and option numbers are split into subranges for each API module.
  Each module receives its entire allocated range of SVC calls, whether implemented or not,
  but return BLE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED for unimplemented or undefined calls in its range.

  Note that the symbols BLE_<module>_SVC_LAST is the end of the allocated SVC range,
  rather than the last SVC function call actually defined and implemented.

  Specific SVC, event and option values are defined in each module's ble_<module>.h file,
  which defines names of each individual SVC code based on the range start value.
